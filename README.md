Bootstrap Basic theme for Anchor CMS
====================================

A simple Bootstrap v3 theme for Anchor CMS.  It's a somewhat loose port to Bootstrap
of the default Anchor theme, intended as a foundation for building more advanced 
Bootstrap themes.

This theme optionally makes use of two custom Site Variables:

* "copyright-owner" - The name of the website's copyright holder.  Defaults to the
                      Site Name if none given.  (Helpful if Site Name is not the same
                      as the copyright owner.)

* "extra-footer-text" - This is for any additional footer text that may need to be
						displayed, such as licensing terms. No visual elements are
						rendered for this item if it's empty or not set.
